# DCEL-Map-Overlay
Computing the Overlay of Two Subdivisions using DCEL Structure.

The code follows the algorithm in "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications" by Mark Overmars, Mark de Berg, Marc van Kreveld, Otfried Cheong Schwarzkopf

To run it, just run main.py. Use timePlot.py (lol why i'm using Java/C naming conventional here) to plot the running time.

You can run on some predicated map or edit the code to load the map yourself ( Although it's hard to follow my code, sorry :( )

Created by me and my friend @anhtu07 in some painful weeks. He's really good at math.
